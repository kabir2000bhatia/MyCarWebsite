				<h2>Sports Car</h2>
				<p class="quote">What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without being a sports car.
				</p>
				<p class="text"> Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic performance (car handling), without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and Ferrari 488 Pista can be considered sports cars, despite vastly different levels of performance. Broader definitions of sports cars include cars "in which performance takes precedence over carrying capacity", or that emphasise the "thrill of driving". In 1920 they started to become popular.
				</p>
				<p class="text">In the United Kingdom, an early recorded usage of the "sports car" was in The Times newspaper in 1919.The first known use of the term in the United States was in 1928. Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s. The term was originally used for two-seat roadsters (cars without a fixed roof), however since the 1970s the term has also been used for cars with a fixed roof (which were previously considered grand tourers).

				<h2>Seating Layout</h2>
				<p class="quote">Traditionally, the most common layout for sports cars was a roadster (a two-seat car without a fixed roof), however there are also several examples of early sports cars with four seats
				</p>
				<p class="text"> Sports cars are not usually intended to regularly transport more than two adult occupants, so most modern sports cars are usually two-seat layout or 2+2 layout (two smaller rear seats for children or occasional adult use). Larger cars with more spacious rear-seat accommodation are usually considered sports sedans rather than sports cars. 
				</p>
				<p class="text">The 1993-1998 McLaren F1 is notable for using a three-seat layout, where the front row consists of a centrally-located driver's seat. Since the 1990s, all-wheel drive has become more common in sports cars. All-wheel drive offers increased traction, although the downside is the added mass of the extra drivetrain components. Examples of all-wheel drive sports cars are the Lamborghini Huracan, Bugatti Veyron and Nissan GT-R.
				Rear engine layouts are not commonly used for sports cars, with the notable exception of the Porsche 911.
